### About
This is a revived school project from 2006 whereby simple melodies were created from a genetic algorithm (using human input as each iteration's selection method).  As part of the initial project, I contributed an alternative approach, instead randomly creating melodies within the confines of music theory guidelines.

For this revival, the two methods are combined, using the latter as a heuristic to the former.  Furthermore, while human input is still solicited to aid in the selection process, this has been opened up to make use of crowd-sourcing to generate new generations.

_Note: Original code was a collaborative team effort during a 2006 senior capstone independent project course at Colorado State University.  I have since lost the contact information for the other 2-3 individuals and in fact no longer remember their names.  However, I wish to give due credit to their work, to the best of my ability._

### Build Instructions

### Code Plan
[] Initialize project, flesh out README, and organize coding steps (6/22)  
[] Research pertinent literature, and collect relevant strategies (6/22)  
[] Review existing code, refactor/revise as necessary, and refine areas still needing attention (6/29)  
[] Finalize music theory heuristics and develop unit tests (7/6)  
[] Finalize current GA and develop unit tests (7/13)  
[] Combine the two methods (7/23)  
[] Create website to host crowd-sourcing (8/3)  
[] Add seeds, with ability to play them (8/10)  
[] Add support for user input to select desired seed to propogate to the next generation (8/17)  
[] Have underlying code generate song generations (8/24)

### Optional Enhancements
[] Allow users to choose multiple seeds  
[] Allow users to choose initial key, tempo, rhythm  
[] Allow for new seeds to be saved to the site for subsequent visitors or downloaded for the user

### Development Challenges

### Currently Working On / Next Steps
* Find visual GA site as a reference
* Research related literature
* Rename project to something clever
